README for Open NSIP 3M-SIP Server

DEPENDENCIES

SIPServer is written entirely in Perl, but it require these CPAN
perl modules to run:

     Net::Server - The SIP server is a Net::Server::Prefork server
     XML::LibXML
     XML::Parser
     XML::Simple - for parsing the config file
     UNIVERSAL::require - for loading the correct ILS interface module
     Clone - for running the test cases

LOGGING

By default, SIPServer uses syslog via log4perl for status and debugging messages.
All syslog messages are logged using the syslog facility 'local6'.
If you need to change this, because something else on your system
is already using that facililty, just change the definition of
'ident' and/or 'facility' in the SIP section of file log4perl.conf.

Make sure to update your syslog configuration to capture facility
'local6' and record it.

See the log4perl documenation for logging to a file or other services.
