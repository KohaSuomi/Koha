   -l --letter <lettercode> use a specific notice rather than the default

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script sends membership expiry reminder notices to patrons.
It queues them in the message queue, which is processed by
the process_message_queue.pl cronjob.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 8

=item B<--help>

Print a brief help message and exits.

=item B<--man>

Prints the manual page and exits.

=item B<-v>

Verbose. Without this flag set, only fatal errors are reported.

=item B<-n>

Do not send any email. Membership expire notices that would have been sent to
the patrons are printed to standard out.

=item B<-c>

Confirm flag: Add this option. The script will only print a usage
statement otherwise.

=item B<-branch>

Optional branchcode to restrict the cronjob to that branch.

=item B<-before>

Optional parameter to extend the selection with a number of days BEFORE
the date set by the preference.

=item B<-after>

Optional parameter to extend the selection with a number of days AFTER
the date set by the preference.

=item B<-where>

Use this option to specify a condition built with columns from the borrowers table

e.g.
--where 'lastseen IS NOT NULL'
will only notify patrons who have been seen.

=item B<-letter>

Optional parameter to use another notice than the default: MEMBERSHIP_EXPIRY

=back

=head1 CONFIGURATION

The content of the messages is configured in Tools -> Notices and slips. Use the MEMBERSHIP_EXPIRY notice or
supply another via the parameters.

Typically, messages are prepared for each patron when the memberships are going to expire.

These emails are staged in the outgoing message queue, as are messages
produced by other features of Koha. This message queue must be
processed regularly by the
F<misc/cronjobs/process_message_queue.pl> program.

In the event that the C<-n> flag is passed to this program, no emails
are sent. Instead, messages are sent on standard output from this
program.

Notices can contain variables enclosed in double angle brackets like
E<lt>E<lt>thisE<gt>E<gt>. Those variables will be replaced with values
specific to the soon expiring members.
Available variables are:

=over

=item E<lt>E<lt>borrowers.*E<gt>E<gt>

any field from the borrowers table

=item E<lt>E<lt>branches.*E<gt>E<gt>

any field from the branches table

=back
