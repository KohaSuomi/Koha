debarrBorrowersWithFines.pl

Creates a debarment for all Borrowers who have fines.

    -h --help       This friendly reminder!

    -c --confirm    Confirm that you want to make your Patrons MAD by barring
                    them from your library because they have ANY unpaid fines.

    -m --message     MANDATORY. The description of the debarment visible to the end-user.
                     or
    -f --messagefile MANDATORY. The file from which to read the message content.

    -e --expiration OPTIONAL. When does the debarment expire?
                    As ISO8601 date, eg  '2015-12-31'
    -y --year       OPTIONAL The year which date matches to accountlines date value.
    --category      OPTIONAL The categorycode if wanted to restrict, can be added more than one 

    -l --limit      OPTIONAL Amount outstanding limit for debarring.
                    This amount and below will not get borrower blocked.
                    Defaults to 0.00

EXAMPLE:

    debarrBorrowersWithFines.pl --confirm -m "This is a description of you bad deeds"
That did almost work.

    debarrBorrowersWithFines.pl -c MAD -m "You didn't play by our rules!" -e '2015-12-31'
    debarrBorrowersWithFines.pl -c MAD -m "You didn't play by our rules!" -y 2018
    debarrBorrowersWithFines.pl -c MAD -m "You didn't play by our rules!" --category ADULT
    debarrBorrowersWithFines.pl -c MAD -m "You didn't play by our rules!" -y 2018 --category CHILD --category ADULT
    debarrBorrowersWithFines.pl -c MAD -f "/home/koha/kohaclone/messagefile"
This works. Always RTFM.
