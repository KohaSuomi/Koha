=head1 NAME

Koha::Caches - Cache handling

=head1 SYNOPSIS

my $cache = Koha::Caches->get_instance();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Description

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=cut

use Modern::Perl;

use Koha::Cache;

our $singleton_caches;

=head2 get_instance

This gets a shared instance of the cache, set up in a very default way. This is
the recommended way to fetch a cache object. If possible, it'll be
persistent across multiple instances.

=cut

sub get_instance {
    my ($class, $subnamespace) = @_;
    $subnamespace //= '';
    $singleton_caches->{$subnamespace} = Koha::Cache->new({}, { subnamespace => $subnamespace } )
        unless $singleton_caches->{$subnamespace};
    return $singleton_caches->{$subnamespace};
}

=head2 flush_L1_caches

=cut

sub flush_L1_caches {
    return unless $singleton_caches;
    for my $cache ( values %$singleton_caches ) {
        $cache->flush_L1_cache;
    }
}

=head2

    Koha::Caches::flush();

Flushes all known L1 and L2 caches

=cut

sub flush {
    return unless $singleton_caches;
    for my $k ( keys %$singleton_caches ) {
        my $cache = $singleton_caches->{$k};
        $cache->flush_all();
        delete $singleton_caches->{$k};
    }
}
